supertem.structures.base

Dataclass-based structures for TEM automation, covering:
  - settings (beam / projection / detector / stage / acquisition outputs)
  - microscope state snapshots
  - image metadata containers
  - executable requests (control-plane objects)

This module supports two distinct contexts:
  (1) data-plane: ingestion and storage of imperfect data (metadata/state/logs)
  (2) control-plane: strict, safe execution of microscope commands

===============================================================================
I. Object Lifecycle (End-to-End)
===============================================================================

The intended lifecycle for objects in this module is:

  1) Ingest (untrusted input)
     - Source: vendor SDK returns, JSON logs, user configs, network payloads
     - Entry:  Class.from_dict(payload, mode=LENIENT or STRICT)
     - Mode propagation: The `mode` provided to a top-level `from_dict(...)` is
       treated as the default for the entire object graph. Nested `from_dict(...)`
       calls MUST pass the same effective mode to children (unless a field
       explicitly overrides it), so a single boundary choice (LENIENT vs STRICT)
       controls all descendants consistently.
     - Goal:   Capture data without crashing, even if imperfect.

  2) Normalize (Integrity of Structure)
     - Happens during __post_init__ via `FieldParser`.
     - Goal:   Produce a well-typed internal representation (Type Safety).
     - Action: Coerce types (str->int), populate structural defaults (None->[]),
               and park unparseable garbage in Extras.raw.
     - Note:   Does NOT check logic. Invalid values (e.g., width=-100) are
               preserved here to ensure data fidelity during ingestion.

  3) Validate (Integrity of Meaning)
     - Happens in validate(mode=...) via `Validator`.
     - Goal:   Enforce domain constraints and logical invariants (Logic Safety).
     - Action (STRICT): Raises exceptions immediately on violation.
     - Action (LENIENT): Records violation in Extras.notes and "Heals" the object
               (e.g., reset width=-100 -> 512, or disable the specific feature).
     - Result: The object is now guaranteed to be logically consistent.

  4) Serialize (JSON-capable representation)
     - Happens in to_dict()
     - Goal:   Produce JSON-serializable output for logging/storage/transport.

  5) Execute (Gatekeeping)
     - Only applicable to control-plane objects (requests/settings).
     - Policy: Validate STRICTLY immediately before hardware interaction.
     - Goal:   Ensure commands applied to the microscope are within hardware limits.

A key rule:
  Objects created via from_dict() are "Type-Safe" but "Logically Unverified."
  They MUST NOT be executed until validate() has been called and passed.

===============================================================================
II. ParseMode and Context
===============================================================================

ParseMode.LENIENT (data-plane default)
  Intended for metadata/state/log ingestion where completeness is not guaranteed.

  Behavior at Construction (__post_init__):
    - Prioritizes survival: construction will not fail due to malformed types.
    - Captures unparseable data in Extras.raw / Extras.notes.
    - Result: Object is type-safe but may contain logically unsafe values (e.g. exposure=-5).

  Behavior at Validation (.validate()):
    - "Heals" invalid logic: unsafe values are reset to defaults or None.
    - Records the intervention in Extras.notes.
    - Result: Object becomes safe for use.

ParseMode.STRICT (control-plane default)
  Intended for objects that will be applied to hardware (requests/settings).

  Behavior at Construction (__post_init__):
    - Prioritizes correctness: raises immediately on malformed types or missing structure.

  Behavior at Validation (.validate()):
    - Enforces constraints: raises note_or_raise(...) on any logical violation.
    - Result: Guaranteed safe to execute, or raises Exception.

===============================================================================
III. The Normalization, Validation, and Gatekeeping Rulebook
===============================================================================

To maintain safety without sacrificing robustness, this module enforces a strict
separation of concerns across three distinct lifecycles:

1. Normalization (__post_init__)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   GOAL:    Integrity of Structure (Type & Shape Safety)
   INPUT:   "Dirty" data (Strings, Nones, Dicts, Missing Keys)
   OUTPUT:  "Clean" data (Correct Python Types, Structurally Complete)
   TOOL:    FieldParser

   Rules:
   A. Coercion is Normalization.
      Convert inputs to their target types.
      (e.g., "128" -> 128, "10 nm" -> Quantity(10, 'nm'))

   B. Structural Defaults are Normalization.
      If a field is `None` but required for the object to exist (e.g., to prevent
      AttributeError later), set a safe default here via `p.model(..., default=...)`.

   C. Structural Patching is Normalization.
      If a required value exists elsewhere in the object graph (e.g., copying
      an ID from an inner object to a missing outer field), perform the copy
      here to complete the structure.

   D. DO NOT Check Logic.
      Do not check if a number is positive, finite, or consistent with other
      fields. If the type is right, let it pass.
      (e.g., `width=-100` is a valid integer. Leave it for validation.)

2. Validation (validate)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   GOAL:    Integrity of Meaning (Internal Logic & Self-Consistency)
   TOOL:    Validator

   Rules:
   A. Trust the Types.
      Do not check `isinstance` or try/except AttributeErrors. If `__post_init__`
      did its job, variables have the correct type. Focus on *values*.

   B. Domain Constraints are Validation.
      Check physical and logical bounds of the object itself.
      (e.g., `width > 0`, `min_limit <= max_limit`).

   C. Internal Cross-Field Consistency.
      Check if two fields within the *same* object or hierarchy contradict each other.
      - "If axis is enabled (`can_tilt=True`), limits MUST be defined (`tilt_limits!=None`)."
      - "If `default_id` is set, it MUST exist in `available_ids`."

   D. Healing is Validation (Lenient Mode Only).
      If a value is structurally sound but logically invalid (e.g., `width=-50`):
        - STRICT Mode: Raise an Exception.
        - LENIENT Mode: "Heal" it to a safe value or disable the feature.

3. Gatekeeping (is_safe_... / is_supported)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   GOAL:    Integrity of Action (Runtime Safety & Hardware Compatibility)
   INPUT:   An external "Request" object (e.g., StagePosition, BeamSettings)
   OUTPUT:  Transient `SafetyCheck` result (Allowed/Rejected + Reasons).

   Rules:
   A. Configs are Guardrails, Requests are Intent.
      The SystemSettings object acts as the Gatekeeper. It validates *external*
      requests against its *internal* limits.

   B. NO State Modification (Anti-Leak Policy).
      Gatekeeping checks happen frequently (e.g. inside UI polling loops).
      Writing failure logs to `self.extra.notes` would cause infinite memory growth.
      Safety methods MUST return a transient result object and MUST NOT modify
      the persistent settings object.

   C. Specificity over Genericity.
      Use specific method names that describe the risk:
      - `is_safe_move(target)`: Checks collision/travel limits (Stage).
      - `is_safe_beam(target)`: Checks voltage/optical limits (Beam).
      - `is_supported(settings)`: Checks driver capabilities (Detector).

===============================================================================
IV. Handling Defaults & None (The 4 Categories)
===============================================================================

To prevent ingestion crashes while ensuring runtime safety, `__post_init__` acts
as a "loading dock" that accepts flexible inputs (including None). However, the
final internal state depends on the object's semantic category，controlled by the
`default` parameter in parser methods.

Universal Rule: All domain-data input fields are typed as `Optional[T] = None`.
(Internal control fields like `_mode` and `extra` are excluded from this rule).

Category A: Configuration & Mandatory Parameters (Strict Runtime)
  - Definition: Operational constants required for logic (timeouts, image formats).
  - Action:     Aggressive Defaulting.
  - Pattern:    `self.val = p.int(self.val, "name", default=10)`

Category B: Structural Containers (Strict Runtime)
  - Definition: Fields holding nested objects/lists.
  - Action:     Structural Defaulting. Never leave as None.
  - Pattern:    `self.child = p.model(Child, self.child, "name", default=Child())`

Category C: Measured State & Optional Boundaries (Nullable Runtime)
  - Definition: Snapshots of reality OR permissive boundaries.
  - Action:     Preserve None.
  - Pattern:    `self.val = p.int(self.val, "name", default=None)`

Category D: Requests & Intents (Nullable Runtime)
  - Definition: Commands to change specific settings (Tristate logic).
  - Action:     Preserve None.
  - Pattern:    `self.val = p.int(self.val, "name", default=None)`

The "Zero Trap" Warning:
  Avoid: `self.val = p.int(...) or 10`  <-- UNSAFE. Input 0 becomes 10.
  Use:   `self.val = p.int(..., default=10)` <-- SAFE. Parser handles 0 vs None.

===============================================================================
V. Extras: Preservation vs. Transient Logic
===============================================================================

`Extras` is the structured container for **persistent** non-canonical information:
  - vendor: vendor-specific extension payloads (namespaced by vendor key)
  - unknown: unknown top-level keys swept during from_dict (forward compatibility)
  - raw: raw values replaced/rejected during normalization
  - notes: structured diagnostics produced by **normalization** or **validation**

Conventions:
  - Use namespaced note keys, e.g. "DetectorSettings.roi_invalid_shape".
  - LENIENT mode should preserve information rather than discard it.

Anti-Pattern Warning:
  Do NOT use `Extras` to store transient errors from high-frequency checks
  (e.g., safety polling). `Extras` travels with the object lifecycle; filling it
  with runtime logs causes memory leaks. Use `SafetyCheck` return values instead.

===============================================================================
VI. Serialization Contract: to_dict Must Be JSON-Capable
===============================================================================

All to_dict() methods must return JSON-serializable output:
  - dataclasses -> dict
  - enums -> str
  - tuples -> lists
  - quantities/units -> plain numbers.

  *AUTOMATION*: Unit stripping and key renaming are handled by `_auto_to_dict`.
  - Standard Rule: Fields with units are stripped to floats, and the key is
    suffixed with the unit (e.g., field `x` + unit `nm` -> key `x_nm`).
  - Override Rule: Specific keys can be manually renamed via `_KEYS` if the
    standard suffix pattern is insufficient.

If a value cannot be expressed safely as JSON, preserve a safe representation in
Extras.raw and record a diagnostic note.

===============================================================================
VII. Implementation Conventions & Usage
===============================================================================

1. Internal Implementation Patterns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To ensure consistent behavior across 20+ structures, every lifecycle method
   must follow a strict pattern using the shared helper functions.

   A. __post_init__ (Normalization)
      - Instantiate: `p = FieldParser(self, self._mode, "ClassName")`
      - Normalize: `self.field = p.type(self.field, "name", default=...)`
      - Constraint: DO NOT perform logic checks here. Only ensure types.
      - Exception: Lightweight value objects (e.g., Point) may skip Extras/Lifecycle
        overhead for performance, but must still normalize fields.

   B. validate(mode=...) (Logic & Healing)
      - Use `v = Validator(self, mode)`
      - Define constraints using `v.check(condition, key, error, heal=lambda: ...)`
      - Standard helpers: `v.check_gt_zero`, `v.check_finite`, `v.check_nested`.
      - Return `v.valid`.

   C. to_dict() (Serialization)
      - Mechanism: Use `_auto_to_dict(self, unit_map=..., key_map=...)`.
      - Configuration: Define `_UNITS` dict mapping fields to target units.
        (e.g. `{"x": Units.NM}` results in key `x_nm` and float value).
      - Overrides: Define `_KEYS` dict only if renaming fields beyond standard
        suffixes (e.g. `{"settle_time": "settle_time_s"}`).
      - Behavior: Automatically handles recursion, list serialization, and extras injection.

   D. from_dict(data, mode=...) (Ingestion)
      - Mechanism: Use `_auto_from_dict(cls, data, mode, alias_map=...)`.
      - Configuration: Define `alias_map` to map incoming keys to internal field names.
        (e.g., `{"x": "x_nm"}` allows input key `x_nm` to populate field `x`).
        Supports strings (1:1 alias) or lists (priority fallback aliases).
      - Behavior:
        1. Introspects dataclass fields to identify valid targets.
        2. Validates input type and harvests unknown keys into `Extras.unknown`.
        3. STRICT Precedence: Direct Key > Alias > Missing.
           (Explicit `None` in input is preserved and not overwritten by an alias).
        4. Passes arguments to constructor; `__post_init__` handles default application.

2. External Usage: Immutability by Policy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To guarantee type safety, external code MUST treat these objects as immutable.

   - DO NOT modify attributes directly:
       `settings.beam.voltage = "300 kV"`  <-- UNSAFE. Bypasses normalization.
                                               Result is a string, not a Quantity.

   - ALWAYS use `dataclasses.replace()`:
       `new_beam = replace(settings.beam, voltage="300 kV")` <-- SAFE.
       This triggers `__init__` and `__post_init__` again, ensuring the string
       is correctly parsed into a Quantity object.

===============================================================================
VIII. The Request Pattern (Control Plane Intents)
===============================================================================

While `Settings` objects define "Configuration" (static parameters) and `State`
objects define "Snapshot" (telemetry), `Request` objects define "Intent."

They are the vehicles for the Control Plane. A Request encapsulates a user's
command to change the microscope's state.

1. Anatomy of a Request
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A Request typically consists of three components:
   A. Target Identity (Mandatory)
      - "Which hardware device?" (e.g., `detector_id`, `aperture_id`).
      - Unlike Settings objects (which can be generic/reusable presets), Requests
        MUST bind to a specific physical device before execution.

   B. The Payload (The "What")
      - Usually reuses a Domain Object (e.g., `StagePosition`, `DetectorSettings`).
      - Fields are `Optional`. A value of `None` means "Do not change."
      - This allows for precise partial updates (e.g., "Change only Exposure").

   C. Modifiers (The "How")
      - Execution flags that don't fit in the domain object.
      - Examples: `relative=True`, `wait_for_settle=True`, `force=False`.

2. The Usage Contract
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A. Construct Strict by Default
      Requests are code-driven commands. They default to `ParseMode.STRICT` because
      ambiguity in a command is dangerous.

   B. Validate Before Sending
      A Request is invalid until `validate()` returns True.
      - It must have a Target ID.
      - It must have a non-empty Payload (no-op requests are rejected).
      - It must satisfy cross-field logic (e.g. relative moves need coordinates).

   C. Ephemeral Lifecycle
      Requests are transient. They are created, validated, executed by the
      Manager/Driver, and then discarded. They are rarely stored long-term.

3. Command, Patch, and Hybrid Requests
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module defines three high-level request shapes based on how "Intent" is
structured and validated:

1) Command Requests (Action-Driven)
   - Examples: StageControlRequest
   - Intent is carried solely by an explicit `action` enum (e.g. STOP, HOME).
   - Validation MUST require `action` to be present. The `target` payload is
     usually not required (or logically ignored) for these operations.

2) Patch Requests (Diff-Driven)
   - Examples: BeamControlRequest, ProjectionControlRequest, VacuumControlRequest,
               ApertureControlRequest, StageMoveRequest
   - Intent is carried by providing at least one non-None field in the `target`
     payload (a "patch").
   - The "empty patch" guard ensures that vendor extras in the payload count
     as valid intent (avoids rejecting vendor-specific updates as empty).

3) Hybrid Requests (Context-Dependent)
   - Examples: DetectorControlRequest, ScanControlRequest
   - The validation logic shifts based on the specific operation mode:
     A. Action-Only (Command-like):
        Example: Detector "INSERT", Scan "STOP".
        Intent is carried by the `action`; `target` settings are optional/ignored.
     B. Payload-Only (Patch-like):
        Example: Detector "Set Exposure" (action=None, target=Settings(...)).
        Intent is carried by the `target` payload settings.
     C. Composite (Action + Payload):
        Example: Scan "START".
        Requires both an `action` (to trigger the engine) AND a `target` (to
        define parameters like dwell time). Validation enforces the presence
        of the payload when the specific action demands it.

4. How to Write a New Request
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. Define the class with `_mode: ParseMode = ParseMode.STRICT`.
   2. Include the ID field (e.g. `beam_id`) and validate its presence.
   3. Include a `payload` or specific fields (use Category D: default=None).
   4. Implement `validate()` to ensure the intent is executable.

   Example:
     req = StageMoveRequest(target=StagePosition(x=Q_(10, 'um')), relative=True)
     if req.validate():
         microscope.stage.move(req)

===============================================================================
IX. Architecture Overview (The "Noun-Verb" Topology)
===============================================================================

The module implements a strict Command-Query Separation (CQS) architecture.
Interaction is divided into "Nouns" (Data/State) and "Verbs" (Intents/Requests).

1. The Data Plane (Nouns)
   - State Objects: Telemetry snapshots (e.g. `MicroscopeState`, `BeamState`).
   - Settings Objects: Configuration payloads (e.g. `BeamSettings`, `ProjectionSettings`).
   - System Settings: Hardware capabilities & limits (e.g. `StageSystemSettings`).

2. The Control Plane (Verbs)
   - Request Objects: Executable commands that wrap Settings with an intent.
   - Naming Convention: `*ControlRequest` for hardware state management,
     `*MoveRequest` for coordinate navigation, and `AcquisitionRequest` for data.

3. Component Map
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Subsystem             | Configuration (Noun)   | Execution (Verb)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Stage (Motion)        | StagePosition          | StageMoveRequest (Nav)
                         |                        | StageControlRequest (Stop)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Beam (Illumination)   | BeamSettings           | BeamControlRequest
   (Gun/Condenser)       |                        |
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Projection (Imaging)  | ProjectionSettings     | ProjectionControlRequest
   (Obj/Projector)       |                        |
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scan (STEM)           | ScanSettings           | ScanControlRequest
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Detector              | DetectorSettings       | AcquisitionRequest (Capture)
                         |                        | DetectorControlRequest (Mech)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Vacuum                | VacuumSettings         | VacuumControlRequest
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Aperture              | ApertureSettings       | ApertureControlRequest
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

===============================================================================
X. Data Organization (The Hierarchy)
===============================================================================

The data plane is organized into two primary trees: Configuration (Static/Limits)
and Telemetry (Dynamic/Snapshot).

1. Configuration Tree (`MicroscopeSettings`)
   Defines how the machine *should* behave and what it is *capable* of.

   MicroscopeSettings
   ├── system: SystemSettings
   │   ├── stage_system: StageSystemSettings (Travel limits, Max speeds)
   │   ├── beam_system: BeamSystemSettings (Voltage limits, Safety checks)
   │   ├── projection_system: ProjectionSystemSettings (Mag ranges, Cam lengths)
   │   ├── scan_system: ScanSystemSettings (Dwell time limits, Scan modes)
   │   ├── detector_system: DetectorSystemSettings (Registry of cameras)
   │   ├── aperture_system: ApertureSystemSettings (Registry of apertures)
   │   └── info: SystemInfo (Static hardware IDs, IP addresses)
   ├── image: ImageOutputSettings (File formats, Save paths)
   └── protocol: Dict (User-defined automation scripts)

2. Telemetry Tree (`MicroscopeState`)
   Defines what the machine is *currently doing*. Used for logs and metadata.

   MicroscopeState
   ├── stage_position: StagePosition (x, y, z, tilt)
   ├── beam: BeamSettings (Voltage, current, spot size)
   ├── projection: ProjectionSettings (Defocus, magnification, optical mode)
   ├── scan: ScanSettings (Active dwell time, grid resolution)
   ├── vacuum: VacuumSettings (Valve states, pressures)
   ├── apertures: Dict[str, ApertureSettings] (State of all inserted apertures)
   └── detectors: Dict[str, DetectorSettings] (State of all active cameras)

===============================================================================
Rationale
===============================================================================

TEM automation consumes heterogeneous and imperfect inputs (vendor SDKs, partial
configs, historical logs). Strict parsing everywhere makes metadata pipelines
brittle; lenient parsing everywhere makes control paths unsafe. This module
provides a consistent lifecycle to be both robust (LENIENT ingestion/storage)
and safe (STRICT validation/execution).
